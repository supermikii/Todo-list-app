# Todo App GUI is in TodoList.gif
Developed using Java. It is my first project but I remember creating my own method to store data's of username and password onto textfile instead of using JSON. The todo app has features like you can set a date for your task, view tasks by date, delete a task or show incompleted tasks. You can also create a username and password so no one else can access your to-do list.
